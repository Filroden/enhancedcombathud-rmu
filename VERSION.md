# Version History

| Version   | Changes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Version 1.1.2** | - Preventative fix to prevent Argon Combat HUD (CORE) giving a warning if a "Loot" actor is selected.|
| **Version 1.1.1** | - Fix search bar filters in the Spell search bar. They should now show available instant and subconscious spells when toggled.|
| **Version 1.1.0** | - Removed all spell attacks from the Attack panel.<br>- In the Spell panel (renamed from Spell (SCR) panel), if a spell has an attack, it shows both the SCR bonus and the OB bonus.<br>- If you cast a spell with an attack, it will change the state of the button after the attack to show it is armed and ready to be used again to make the attack roll.<br>- Clicking the button again (with your target selected / template placed) will do the attack and return the button to its unarmed state.<br>- The armed state has a slightly warmer background, a different icon, and only shows OB bonus (and the Place Template reminder for area spells).<br>- If the SCR roll fails (which the HUD cannot detect), you can dismiss the armed state by right-clicking the button.|
| **Version 1.0.1** | - Moved to ApplicationV2.<br>- Added a check inside the 'Set Defenses' dialogue to warn users if they are trying to set Passive Dodge and Passive Block at the same time.<br>- Made sure that spell casting tooltips always appear above their buttons.|
| **Version 1.0.0** | **PUBLIC RELEASE**<br>- Updated documentation.<br>- Updated master css theme.|
| **Version 0.6.2** | - Added a reset to the pace penalty if an attack, spell or perception action are taken during the phase (this will only work if they are triggered by using the HUD, not from the character sheet). Pace penalty tracking then begins again in the next phase from 0.<br>- Fixed bugs in calculating AP cost for in-phase dedicated movement.<br>- All movement is now limited by encumbrance.<br>- The info box shows a warning if the token is spending more than 1 AP per phase (which could be true, but acts as a fail safe).<br>- Improved documentation of the movement HUD code to show calculation logic.|
| **Version 0.6.1** | - Fixed bug in calculating AP cost for in-phase dedicated movement.<br>- Simplified movement HUD to a single track and a more detailed information box to show how far you can move until you incur another AP cost or move to a higher penalty.|
| **Version 0.6.0** | **MOVEMENT HUD UPDATE**<br>Replaced Argon HUD movement tracker with dedicated RMU tracker. This shows two tracks only during combat.<br><br>- **Track 1: Dedicated Movement** is for tracking dedicated movement using AP and shows the total distance travelled in the round (accumulating each phase).<br>- **Track 2: Acting while Moving** is for tracking acting while moving and is a speed gauge, showing the distance travelled that phase and including a marker to show the fastest pace used in all phases that round and the penalty associated with that pace.<br><br>A tactical movement information box summarises the information in both tracks.|
| **Version 0.5.6** | - Fixed issue with weapons with multiple attack variants (e.g., 1H or 2H) would use only the first variant for all attacks.<br>- Fixed issue where clearing a search in the skill search bar (text or favourite filer) would not restore visibility of the skills panel.<br>- Updated UI theme to latest version.|
| **Version 0.5.5** | - Updated theme colours to use HSL values.|
| **Version 0.5.4** | - Added filters to the spell panel for "instant" and "sub-conscious" spells.<br>- Added icons to all individual skill buttons for consistency.<br>- Resolved a bug where clearing the search filter (or un-toggling the last filter) would incorrectly show all items instead of closing the accordion in the spell and skill panels.<br>- Made under-the-covers code improvements for stability and maintainability.|
| **Version 0.5.3** | - Added a defence dialogue to set dodge, block (when available) and other DB modifiers.<br>- Re-themed elements of the module to follow my other modules rather than system colours.|
| **Version 0.5.2** | - Added toggle buttons to weapons/shields to allow them to be quickly equipped or unequipped from within the HUD. |
| **Version 0.5.1** | - Added macro drawer above portrait.<br>- Hidden weapon swap bar.|
| **Version 0.5.0** | - Refactored and modularised the codebase.<br>- Added Spell SCR (Spell panel) and Spell Attack rolls (attack panel). Spell Mastery rolls were already available in the Skills panel.<br>- Added additional styling for dual level accordion panels for SCR rolls.<br>- Added description to the skill tooltip. |

| **Version 0.4.3** | - Minor CSS change to consolidate styles. |
